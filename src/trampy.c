/* trampy.c provides a piece of PAC (Position Agnostic Code) that can be
 * injected into traced processes to securily fork them. That is,
 * it throws the traced process and its newly forked child into a loop
 * allowing tracy to attach to the child and afterwards restore both processes
 * as if nothing happened, save for the original syscall.
 *
 * XXX: Trampy will NOT work when compiled with -fPIC (position independent code)
 * due to its modification of %ebx on x86 architectures, in fact it probably
 * won't even compile as GCC tends to complain about inline assembly modifying
 * the PIC base-register.
 * This might need to be fixed in the future or perhaps we would even want
 * pure assembly instead of inlining. ;-)
